 <h1>The Best Movies According to Bhavana</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3> Lucky Bhaaskar</h3>
 <p> I love this movie as it explains the peccable journey of a poor man making his way into the rich life.</p>
 <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81902035"> Watch Lucky Bhaaskar on Netflix</a>
 <h3>Jathiratnalu</h3>
 <p> This movie plot is not excellent, but the comedy track in this movie has made the audience laugh their lungs out. It's a family movie and a must watch</p>

<h3>Maharaja</h3>
<p> This Tamizh movie starring Vijay Sethupathi has one of the best twists. This is about a man who keeps committing endless crimes or is a standby to crimes. It shows that evil makes its way back to you, that's how fate is.</p>
